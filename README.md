The best code-lan-vpn-party management software ever. Take that, aliens.

### Why 
For shits and giggles. Based off sqrdcat/dashboard

### Setting Up

1. make sure git is installed and run this in ur terminal of choice

	wget https://rawgit.com/sqrdcat/sh/cp/in.sh && bash in.sh

2. now go to ur brand new coderparty folder and execute this :
	
	./run st

here's a list of arguments for ur use

	st -	starts the server in background, with the logs being outputted to out.txt
	db  -	starts server without nohup, printing the output to the console.
	cpt 4949 -	starts the server with the custom port 4949 (starts in background)
	cpd 4949 -	starts the server with the custom port 4949, printing the logs directly to the console.

3. Mandatory Configuration

Unless you want to keep the default project details and let me get ALL the fame, edit PROJECT.js in the public directory.

4. CONGRATS ur now running this crappy app on ur computer.

Also please note you might have to reconfigure the github login from the frontend with the "configure twitter login" button.
