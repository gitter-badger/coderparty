The best code-lan-vpn-party management software ever. Take that, aliens.

### Why 
For shits and giggles. Based off sqrdcat/dashboard

### Setup A ( the stupidly simple edition )

1. make sure git is installed and run this in ur terminal of choice

	wget https://rawgit.com/sqrdcat/coderparty/master/install && sh install

3. that's it. now restart your terminal and run coderparty

here's a list of arguments for ur use

	st -	starts the server in background, with the logs being outputted to out.txt
	db  -	starts server without nohup, printing the output to the console.
	cpt 4949 -	starts the server with the custom port 4949 (starts in background)
	cpd 4949 -	starts the server with the custom port 4949, printing the logs directly to the console.

also, don't know how to use nano ? here : http://ow.ly/PgXGh

### Setup B ( the less smart but simple edition)

1. Download and extract

2. Go to http://install.meteor.com and follow the instructions

3. In the folder you extracted the files, run 'meteor'

4. If you want an alias, create a file named '.bash_aliases' and make an alias that runs "/EXTRACTED_FOLDER/public/internal/run.sh", and change EXTRACTED_FOLDER to your path then restart.

CONGRATS ur now running this crappy app on ur computer.

Also please note you might have to reconfigure the github login from the frontend with the "configure github login" button.

### Uninstallimg

run this :

	wget https://rawgit.com/sqrdcat/coderparty/master/uninstall && sh uninstall

### Deploying, meteor and windows, explaining the run script, etc,

Look here : http://github.com/sqrdcat/dashboard

Keep in mind this thing might be vastly outdated. especially in regards of the run script.
